                       <p class="first-para" style="font-size:19;line-height:1.2;">  <span style="font-size:40;font-weight:700;" >HI</span> , I'm Maitrey Ganesh Mokal. A 22 years old IT Graduate who've always been a Fitness freak, now Shaping People's Bodies with the best & latest knowledge gained through my own fitness journey & much more.
I've completed the Nutrition & Personal Trainer certification from INFS & IFSA Academy.</p>
<p class="first-para" style="font-size:19;line-height:1.2;"> 
My personal transformation, Fat to Fit started when i was in my 12th standard. After hitting gym almost for 1 year with the Personal Trainer, the results were not something that i had desired. That's when i decided to learn about Fitness & bring the best out of me. And that was it, My First Transformation.</p>
                        <p class="second-para" style="font-size:19;line-height:1.2;">Just like others, I started gaining knowledge about Fitness & Nutrition through YouTube & other sources. Then to take things further, i decided to take actual Nutrition & Fitness course, which has enriched my knowledge over the time.

Starting from my friends and family, without taking a single penny i applied all my knowledge & hardwork into transforming them. This decision gave me a lot of experience to work with now.

Now it's your turn, unleash the beast inside you. Get trained, get Transformed for the better You.</p>
